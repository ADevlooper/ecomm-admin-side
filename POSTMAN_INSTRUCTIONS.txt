How to check this project with Postman

Prerequisites
- Start the server from the project root:
  pnpm start
- By default the app listens at: http://localhost:3000
- Make sure `uploads/` folder exists and is writable (used for file uploads)

Base URL
- http://localhost:3000

Key endpoints (HTTP method + path)
- Products (HTML views + form-driven endpoints)
  - GET  /products                 -> list products (renders HTML)
  - GET  /products/new             -> product creation form (HTML)
  - POST /products/create          -> create product (multipart/form-data)
      • form keys: name, description, price, image (file)
      • response: redirects to `/products` (HTML)
  - GET  /products/edit/:id        -> edit form (HTML)
  - POST /products/update/:id      -> update product (multipart/form-data)
      • same form keys as create
      • response: redirects to `/products`
  - POST /products/delete/:id      -> delete product (form submit)
      • response: redirects to `/products`

- Categories (JSON / HTML depending on view)
  - GET    /categories             -> list categories (renders `categories` view)
  - POST   /categories             -> create category
      • body: x-www-form-urlencoded OR application/json
      • fields: name, slug, description
      • response: redirect to `/categories` (HTML)
  - GET    /categories/:id         -> edit category form (HTML)
  - PUT    /categories/:id         -> update category (application/json or urlencoded)
  - DELETE /categories/:id         -> delete category

- Images (JSON API endpoints)
  - GET    /images                 -> list all image records (returns JSON)
  - POST   /images                 -> upload/create image for a product (multipart/form-data)
      • form keys: product_id (number), alt_text (optional), image (file)
      • response: 201 JSON of created record
  - GET    /images/:id             -> get image record (JSON)
  - DELETE /images/:id             -> delete image record (JSON)

Postman setup notes
- For multipart file uploads (products and images):
  1. Select method POST and set full URL (example `http://localhost:3000/products/create`).
  2. In the "Body" tab choose `form-data`.
  3. For each field, add a key: for files change the type from `Text` to `File` and choose a file from disk.
     • Products: keys are `name`, `description`, `price`, and `image` (File).
     • Images endpoint: keys are `product_id`, `alt_text` (optional), and `image` (File).
  4. Send the request. For HTML endpoints that redirect, Postman may show the final HTML response.

- For JSON endpoints (Images GET/DELETE, Categories PUT/DELETE optionally):
  1. Choose method (GET, PUT, DELETE) and full URL.
  2. For PUT/POST with JSON body: select Body -> raw -> JSON (application/json) and send JSON payload.
     Example JSON for categories:
     {
       "name": "Example",
       "slug": "example",
       "description": "Example category"
     }

Example Postman requests
- Create product (multipart/form-data)
  Method: POST
  URL: http://localhost:3000/products/create
  Body -> form-data:
    name: "Test product"
    description: "A short description"
    price: 199.99
    image: (choose file)

- Create category (JSON)
  Method: POST
  URL: http://localhost:3000/categories
  Body -> raw -> JSON:
    { "name": "Shoes", "slug": "shoes", "description": "Footwear" }

- Upload image for product (multipart)
  Method: POST
  URL: http://localhost:3000/images
  Body -> form-data:
    product_id: 1
    alt_text: "Front view"
    image: (choose file)

Troubleshooting & tips
- Ensure the server is running and listen address/port match Postman URL.
- 404 responses: check you used the correct route prefix (note products routes are mounted under `/products`).
- File upload errors: verify Postman uses `form-data` and the file key matches `image` (the middleware is `upload.single('image')`).
- Redirect responses: product create/update endpoints redirect to HTML views. If you want the raw response, disable automatic redirect following in Postman settings.
- Large file errors (413): check upload limits in middleware (see `middlewares/upload.js`) and the server's body parser limits.
- Check server logs/terminal for stack traces — helpful for diagnosing crashes or DB errors.

Quick curl examples
- Create product (multipart):
  curl -v -X POST http://localhost:3000/products/create \
    -F "name=CLI product" \
    -F "description=desc" \
    -F "price=9.99" \
    -F "image=@/path/to/image.jpg"

- Create category (JSON):
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/categories \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name":"Books","slug":"books","description":"Reading"}'

If you want, I can:
- Start the server and run a few Postman-like requests here to verify endpoints.
- Add a Postman collection file (`.json`) with prebuilt requests for quick import.
